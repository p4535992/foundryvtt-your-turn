Your Turn! is a module that adds a visual display whenever the turn changes. 

# Features
Color automatically changes with player and GM color! 

Hidden monsters have a black silhoutte behind them 

# Maintenance

If you encounter any bugs let me know in this repo. I made this module originally as an ADHD Hyperfixation , 
so I can't gurantee maintence will be fast or ever, unfortunately.
